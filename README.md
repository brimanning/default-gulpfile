# Default Gulpfile

Working on a few different projects with different libraries and requirements, I found that I like to have a default gulpfile to start. This way, I can add and remove sections easily without having to recall just how to set it up every time. Setup of a new project is often the slowest time, the goal here was to speed it up just a bit with some building blocks to start.
